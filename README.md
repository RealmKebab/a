# What?
[Liquid](https://modrinth.com/modpack/liquid) is a non-configured, normal set of performance that you would see in minecraft `ðŸ™‚/Admin/AppData/.minecraft/mods` folders turned into a modpack.

Your FPS heavily depends on your system.
And no, I'm not doing a test on 1.20 because I've already given the test results on 1.19.4 in the description of the modpack. (this doesn't relate to the why section)

(fun fact this modpack is inspired by [adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline))
# Why?
I have created liquid for the simple reason:
Low-end hardware is not the best at handling Minecraft, especially with the 2GB of RAM allocated with their 4GB motorcycle.
Vanilla isn't at all stable on that hardware.

This modpack has preferences that are in your feelings:

Very Bad -> Bad -> Reasonable <-> Okay <-> Good <-> Great <-> Perfect

If you're asking why I didn't host this on CurseForge, CurseForge is trash. And I mean it.
Jesus christ, it is HELL to even upload something to the site.
And judging from the recent fractureiser malware, modrinth is much safer.

# Forge, Fabric, Quilt
Forge, No.
Straight up, no.
I'm not handling all those updates that Forge does every single second.
*7 minutes later, another Forge beta version, fucking hell*

We already have a fabric version.
About quilt, I'm unsure.

# How?
Due to the performance mods on Fabric and how they have a great boost in performance, I was able to make this modpack.
All the mods used are listed in the dependencies section in the [versions](https://modrinth.com/modpack/liquid/version/v3-not-fully)

# Team
I have no team; this is just me using Prism to update and export the modpack.

Try it! You'll like it. https://prismlauncher.org
