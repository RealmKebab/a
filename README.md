# What?
[Liquid](https://modrinth.com/modpack/liquid) is a non-configured, normal set of performance that you would see in minecraft `ðŸ™‚/Admin/AppData/.minecraft/mods` folders turned into a modpack.

Your FPS heavily depends on your system.
And no, I'm not doing a test on 1.20 because I've already given the test results on 1.19.4 in the description of the modpack. (this doesn't relate to the why section)

(fun fact this modpack is inspired by [adrenaline](https://modrinth.com/modpack/adrenaline))
# Why?
I have created liquid for the simple reason:
Low-end hardware is not the best at handling Minecraft, especially with the 2GB of RAM allocated with their 4GB laptop or desktop.
Vanilla isn't at all stable on that hardware.

# Forge, Fabric, Quilt
Forge, No.
Straight up, no.
I'm not handling all those updates that Forge does every single second.
*7 minutes later, another Forge beta version, fucking hell*

We already have a fabric version.
About quilt, I'm unsure.
