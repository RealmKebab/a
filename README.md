# What?
[Liquid](https://modrinth.com/modpack/liquid) is a non-configured, normal set of performance that you would see in minecraft `/User/AppData/.minecraft/mods` folders turned into a modpack.

# Why?
I have created Liquid for the simple reason:  
Better Minecraft Performance on Low-end hardware

# Forge, Fabric, Quilt
Forge - No  
Fabric - What do you use to load this modpack, Forge?  
Quilt - Probably Not (no plans for it currently)
